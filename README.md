# POPulate
Populate is a chrome extension that visualizes your most frequented visits on the new tab page. You have the ability to filter these items and view the result in both graph and list view.

I used d3 for the graph and jQuery to create the interface.

Download it on the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/populate/gnckamlehhmecnafkcneapmpnnjggppe)
